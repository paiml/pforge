# pforge: EXTREME TDD for MCP Servers

**Build production-ready Model Context Protocol servers with zero boilerplate and radical quality enforcement**

---

## Zero Boilerplate. Extreme Quality. Sub-Microsecond Performance.

pforge is a declarative framework for building MCP servers using pure YAML configuration - powered by EXTREME Test-Driven Development methodology and enforced by PMAT quality gates.

### What You'll Learn

- **EXTREME TDD**: 5-minute RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles with zero tolerance quality gates
- **Toyota Production System**: Apply Lean manufacturing principles to software development
- **MCP Server Development**: Build tools, resources, and prompts with type safety
- **Quality Enforcement**: Pre-commit hooks, complexity analysis, mutation testing
- **Production Performance**: <1Î¼s dispatch, >100K req/s throughput, <100ms cold start

### Who This Book Is For

- **MCP developers** wanting to ship faster with higher quality
- **TDD practitioners** seeking a more disciplined, time-boxed approach
- **Quality engineers** interested in automated quality enforcement
- **Rust developers** building high-performance tooling

### The pforge Philosophy

> "Quality is not an act, it is a habit." - Aristotle

pforge enforces quality through **automation**, not willpower:
- Pre-commit hooks block low-quality code
- 5-minute TDD cycles prevent complexity
- PMAT metrics track technical debt
- Property tests verify invariants
- Mutation tests validate test quality

### Current Status

- **Version**: 0.1.0-alpha
- **Test Coverage**: 80.54%
- **TDG Score**: 96/100 (A+)
- **Tests**: 115 passing (100% pass rate)
- **Complexity**: Max 9 (target: <20)
