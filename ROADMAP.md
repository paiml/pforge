## EXTREME TDD Methodology

### Cycle Structure (5-minute max)
1. **RED (2 min)**: Write comprehensive failing tests
2. **GREEN (2 min)**: Minimum code to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR (1 min)**: Clean code, run quality gates
4. **COMMIT**: If quality gates pass
5. **RESET**: If cycle exceeds 5 minutes

### Per-Ticket Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create ticket branch
git checkout -b ticket/PFORGE-XXXX

# 2. RED: Write failing tests
vim tests/ticket_XXXX_tests.rs
cargo test  # Must FAIL

# 3. GREEN: Minimal implementation
vim src/feature.rs
cargo test  # Must PASS

# 4. REFACTOR: Clean code
cargo clippy
cargo fmt
pmat analyze complexity --max 20
pmat analyze tdg --min 0.75

# 5. COMMIT: Atomic commit
git add .
git commit -m "[PFORGE-XXXX] Feature implementation"

# 6. CI verification
cargo build --release
cargo test --all-features
cargo tarpaulin
cargo mutants
```
